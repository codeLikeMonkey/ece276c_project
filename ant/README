In the final project, we have implemented our dropout in 6 games.  

In each files, it contains:

ddpg.py 		--- traditional ddpg algorithm
utils.py 		--- required functions
plot_[game].ipynb	--- plots

[our upgraded methods]
[game]_drop.pkl 		--- dropout algorithm ddpg data
[game]_drop_model.pkl		--- dropout algorithm ddpg model
[game]_drop.ipynb		--- dropout algorithm ddpg notebook
[game]_drop_video.ipynb		--- dropout algorithm ddpg video

[game].pkl 		--- ddpg data
[game]_model.pkl	--- ddpg model
[game].ipynb		--- ddpg notebook
[game]_video.pynb	--- ddpg video
